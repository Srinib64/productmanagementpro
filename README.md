Additional Notes

The application is built with JavaScript to ensure type safety and better code maintenance.
State management is implemented using React's Context API for simplicity and efficiency.
Thorough form validation is implemented using Ant Design's Form component, providing clear error messages to users.
Custom styling and theming are applied to Ant Design components to align with the application's branding style.
